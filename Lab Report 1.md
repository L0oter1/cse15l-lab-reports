This writeup covers the 3 command line prompts I've learned for the first week fo CSE 15L

`cd`

The `cd` command stands for change directory. It is meant to be used with an argument to go to a new directory.
**No Arguments**

We first started off with `pwd` which shows that our working directory is /home/. With that after we used `cd` which did not give an output. Afterwards, we check our working directory and see that there is no change. This is to be expected because we did not put in an argument for cd.

**Directory as Argument**

**File as Argument**

`ls`


`cat`
